This is model for Kaggle data set "Credit Card Approval Prediction": https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction
Here I made some vintage plot and build random forest model for prediction bad customers with delinquency 60+.
Main problem of this data set in very imbalanced distribution of good/bad customers.
